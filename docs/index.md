description: A Unity3D Plugin for Non-Head Mounted Virtual Reality Display Systems
---

The UniCAVE project was created by students and researchers at UW-Madison who are passionate about immersive display environments. The UniCAVE project aims to build a plugin for [Unity3D](https://unity.com) that provides support for CAVE environments utilizing features built into the engine. This approach enables a user to configure their system entirely in the Unity3D editor providing a simplified method for supporting adapting existing Unity projects for distributed visualization platforms.

The concept for the plugin is to have a three step approach for integration:

![Step 1]({{'images/step1.png' | absolute_url}} "Step 1")

![Step 2]({{'images/step2.png'  | absolute_url}} "Step 2")

![Step 3]({{'images/step3.png' | absolute_url}} "Step 3")

This project is currently **_under development and is a work in progress_**.  Please feel free to _contribute to this project_ or read over the [documentation](https://github.com/widVE/UniCAVE/wiki) to learn if the plugin is right for you.

As the project does not receive any financial support from the campus, federal agency or external corporation all project development and support occurs on an ad hoc basis. If you have a request for features and/or support for the UniCAVE project we ask that you consider [donating to the project](https://secure.supportuw.org/give/?id=ac987d37-46b8-46f5-b2ae-71bba33ead5f). All donations will go towards ensuring that the UniCAVE project remains a free, open-source tool for all to use.
